# My NANORC Configuration files
The Nano editor is a popular text editor used mostly within a Linux or BSD console. I have seperate configuration files to help differentiate when editing in sudo mode.

## Installation
According to the names copy the rc files into your Root \ User  home directories and rename it to ".nanorc".<br>
Note: You may want to comment out the setting which requires a seperate .nanorc\backup directory. Nano will complain if the directories don't exists. Be sure to edit the directory path pointing to all the syntax highlighting files.
